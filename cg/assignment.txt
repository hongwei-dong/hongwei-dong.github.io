Programming Exercises
6. write a program to animate the nest interpolating process to find any point Q(u) given the parameter u.
    hint: You could divided the parameter range[0,1] into 100 discret parameters ui,and animate the interpolation of point Q(ui).
    your aimation should be like this link(http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Bezier_3_big.gif).
